# Weather-Project
Project for Summer 2022

My first project, focusing on displaying weather.

Used Openweather API to collect weather information given a city using Javascript

Dispalyed it with HTML using the Live server extension in VS code and styled the page using CSS.

To execute/use, download all files and the Live Server extension on VS code. Then start a server using the HTML page. Can be started in different ways if prefer other ways to host the website.
